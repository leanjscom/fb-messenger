## ReactJS Facebook messenger

## Learning objectives
- Differentiate between declarative and imperative programming
- Identify what's state and which components should hold it
- Determine when to lift the state up

## Requirements

You need to be comfortable writing JavaScript (ES6: Module system, class syntax, destructuring assignment).
You need to have `node`and `npm`installed in your computer.

## Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger.git
```

Then `cd` into fb-messenger

```sh
cd fb-messenger
```

## Branches

You will need to head to the correct branch for the exercise.

How? run:

```sh
git pull --all

git branch --all

git checkout thinking-in-react
```

## Getting started:

```sh
yarn && yarn start
```

### We recommend you to start from top to bottom, and refactor, refactor, refactor

1. Replace the “footer” HTML at the bottom of App/index.js using the src/Footer.js component.

2. Refactor the topbar section by creating a functional component and pass the dependencies via props. Make sure everything works Hint: this will be similar to Modal.js

3. Create a component for “Messenger” and pass down the dependencies from App via props. Make sure everything works. You can start by making a Messenger folder with an index.js.

4. Is there any state in App/index.js that should be in the Messenger component? Refactor this logic out of App/index.js and into Messenger. Then, create further functional components from the contents of Messenger and pass them down dependencies via props. Hint: Create a Threads.js file and a Chat folder with an index.js file inside the Messenger folder.

5. Question: Is it possible to move showModal from App/index.js down the tree? why/why not?

6. Create a Link component for the a tags in the footer. Who are the children of the Link component? Link should receive a prop called `to` that becomes the href of the <a href={to} ...

## Bonus exercise

Split the Chat component into the following components:

- ChatBar.js
- Messages.js
- UserDetail.js
- index.js
